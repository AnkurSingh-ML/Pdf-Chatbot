# Extraction of Text from PDF

* Selecting the one which gives the maximum info from the pdfs.

1. PyPDF2

Description: Pure-Python library to read, write, and split PDF files. Basic text extraction support.

Pros:

Simple to use and widely available (pip install PyPDF2).

Good for text-based PDFs (not images).

Can extract metadata, merge/split PDFs, and handle encryption.

Lightweight and no dependencies.

Cons:

Fails on complex layouts (multi-column, tables).

Can‚Äôt extract text from scanned/image-based PDFs.

Formatting is often lost.

‚úÖ Best for: Simple, text-based PDFs without tables or images.

üìÑ 2. pdfplumber

Description: Built on pdfminer.six but provides an easier API and layout-aware extraction (detects text blocks, tables, lines).

Pros:

Extracts structured text, tables, rectangles, and images.

Retains layout structure (columns, spacing).

Supports visual debugging (shows text bounding boxes).

Can access per-character coordinates.

Cons:

Slower than PyPDF2 due to detailed layout parsing.

Doesn‚Äôt work for scanned PDFs (no OCR).

‚úÖ Best for: Extracting structured data or tables from text-based PDFs.

üìò 3. pdfminer.six

Description: Core text extraction engine for many other libraries.

Pros:

Extracts text with positions and layout info.

Handles Unicode and non-English text well.

Works at low level (granular control over parsing).

Cons:

Complex API (steeper learning curve).

Slower performance for large files.

Can‚Äôt handle image-based PDFs (no OCR).

‚úÖ Best for: Developers needing fine control and layout-aware extraction.

üß© 4. PyMuPDF (fitz)

Description: Python binding for MuPDF, a lightweight and fast PDF engine.

Pros:

Extremely fast and memory efficient.

Can extract text, images, and annotations.

Works on encrypted PDFs.

Provides bounding boxes, fonts, and layout info.

Can extract text from scanned PDFs if combined with OCR.

Cons:

Raw text extraction sometimes merges lines awkwardly.

Requires manual OCR integration for scanned documents.

‚úÖ Best for: Performance-heavy or hybrid extraction (text + layout).

üß† 5. Tika (Apache Tika)

Description: A Java-based tool (uses Tika server or JAR) wrapped with Python (tika library).

Pros:

Extracts text and metadata robustly from nearly all formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, etc.).

Handles complex layouts fairly well.

Uses Apache PDFBox under the hood.

Cons:

Needs Java runtime.

Slower startup (spins up JVM).

Not great for image-based PDFs.

‚úÖ Best for: Batch or enterprise-grade extraction from multiple file types.

üßæ 6. pdf2image + pytesseract

Description: Converts each page of a PDF into an image, then performs OCR using Tesseract.

Pros:

Works for scanned PDFs (image-based).

Can extract handwritten or non-digital text.

Language models available for multilingual OCR.

Cons:

Slow, especially for large PDFs.

OCR errors possible with noisy or low-quality scans.

Loses layout fidelity.

Requires Tesseract installed separately.

‚úÖ Best for: Scanned/image PDFs (where text isn‚Äôt embedded).

üß† 7. pymupdf + pytesseract (Hybrid)

Description: Combine PyMuPDF for image extraction and pytesseract for OCR.

Pros:

Full control over OCR pipeline.

Can process both text-based and image-based pages.

Works page-by-page (can skip already-text pages).

Cons:

Manual setup and configuration.

OCR adds computational overhead.

‚úÖ Best for: Mixed PDFs (some pages text, others scanned).

üèóÔ∏è 8. camelot / tabula-py

Description: Designed specifically for table extraction from PDFs.

Pros:

Great for tabular data (structured tables).

Provides Pandas DataFrame output.

Works well with clearly defined grid tables.

Cons:

Works only for text-based PDFs, not scanned ones.

Tables without clear lines may fail.

Not a general text extractor.

‚úÖ Best for: Extracting tables from PDFs for data analysis.

üåê 9. unstructured (by Unstructured.io)

Description: AI-powered library for extracting semantic chunks (headings, paragraphs, lists, tables) from PDFs.

Pros:

Uses modern parsing for semantic segmentation.

Outputs structured JSON (good for RAG/LLM pipelines).

Integrates with LangChain and LlamaIndex.

Cons:

Requires extra dependencies (like pdfminer.six, Pillow).

Can be slower than basic parsers.

Not built for OCR.

‚úÖ Best for: AI/LLM pipelines and chunked embeddings.

üßÆ 10. Textract (AWS) and Azure Form Recognizer

Description: Cloud-based OCR & layout analysis tools.

Pros:

Can parse scanned, handwritten, and complex layouts.

Outputs structured JSON (with positions, confidence scores).

Scales well for production.

Cons:

Paid (AWS / Azure cost per page).

Requires cloud setup and API calls.

Not ideal for offline use.

‚úÖ Best for: Enterprise and OCR-heavy automation workflows.
